# Implement famous machine learning algorithms from scratch
Have you ever learned a machine learning algorithm and you want to implement it by yourself? I do believe one of the best ways to deeply understand and master a machine learning algorithm is to be able to implement it from scratch. In this projects, I implemented some of the most famous machine learning algorithms from scatch using purely `python` and it's famous numerical computing library [numpy](https://numpy.org/), and visualize the results with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). I also compare the results from implemented algorithms against algorithms from [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), to see how well it performs. These implementations might not be the most optimal way, I simplified some complex aspects of the algorithms to make it easier to implement.

## Implemented algorithms
- Supervised learning:
	- Regression:
		- Linear Regression
		- Neural Networks
  - Classification:
	  - Logistic Regression
		- Softmax Regression
		- Support Vector Machine
		- Radial Basis Function Network
- Unsupervised learning:
	- Dimensionalty reduction:
		- Pricipal Component Analysis
		- T-SNE
		- Linear Discriminant Analysis
		- Isomap
		- Autoencoder
		- Locally Linear Embedding
		- Multi-dimensional Scaling
		- Sammon mapping
	- Clustering:
		- DBSCAN
		- Gaussian Mixtured Model
    - Hierarchical Clustering
		- K-means
    - Meanshift
		- Spectral Clustering

			
## Todo
- Add explanation for the implement of each algorithm
- Add useful resources to learn about these algorithms
